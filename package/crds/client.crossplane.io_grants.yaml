        description: Grant is the Schema for the Grants API. Auth0 uses various grant
          types, or methods by which you grant limited access to your resources to
          another entity without exposing credentials. The OAuth 2.0 protocol supports
          several types of grants, which allow different types of access. This resource
          allows you to create and manage client grants used with configured Auth0
          clients.

                  avoid updating them after creation. This is useful for fields that are
                  required on creation, but we do not desire to update them after creation,
                  for example because of an external controller is managing them, like an
                  autoscaler.
